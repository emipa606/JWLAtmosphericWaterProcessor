Provides a means of producing Dubs Bad Hygiene water without any water source in exchange for a very large amount of power.

I felt the default compatibility built into DBH for SOS2 was lacking as it didn't produce water for storage systems and therefore left pools, tubs, cooling towers, etc. from being filled. So I devised this as a means of producing large amounts water in space, although you don't need SOS2 to use this and can build it on any biome.

Must be built without a roof above. Place on a 4x4 hardpoint for ships.

Safe to add or remove at any time. May produce a one time red error on startup after removing.

The Atmospheric Water Processor cannot push water directly into fillable items. It needs to pass through water storage first. Make sure you have at least one storage tank connected on the network for it to work. 

It will also consume power even if the water network is full. Be sure to toggle power on/off as needed.

Should be compatible with everything.

If you have [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2574489704]Simple FX: Smoke[/url] installed, the building will produce a thick blue cloud of mechanites while running.
